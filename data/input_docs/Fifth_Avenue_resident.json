In a photograph of the two taken at a high society gala, Agent Tammy Preston noted that he appeared to be wearing a ring possibly resembling one from the red room that recurred frequently in Garland Briggs' dossier, although the resolution was too low to verify its identity. Earlier, a similar ring was documented among the belongings of Lana's late husband, Douglas Milford.\nThe character is a veiled reference to Donald John Trump (born June 19, 1946), a former real estate developer and television producer, and the 45th President of the United States."}
