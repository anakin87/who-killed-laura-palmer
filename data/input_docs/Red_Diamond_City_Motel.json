Laura's father Leland solicited Banks' services and unwittingly booked a foursome with Ronette and his own daughter, but left in a hurry when he saw her waiting in their room. Meanwhile, Pierre ran around the motel courtyard in a circle, hopping, before disappearing.\nBehind the scenes\nThe motel scenes were filmed at the Mount Si Motel in North Bend, Washington, later used again for The Dutchman's Lodge in Twin Peaks (2017). In the shooting script, the motel was instead called the Blue Diamond City Motel."}
