You don't ever want to know about that.\"\n \u2015Hawk\nA recurring black symbol was associated with a presence on Blue Pine Mountain in northeastern Washington State. It resembled a black circle with two \"ears\" protruding from either side.\nIn a living Nez Perce map belonging to Deputy Hawk, the symbol was drawn above the summit of Blue Pine Mountain. When asked, Hawk gravely told Sheriff Frank Truman that he didn't want to know about what it represented.\nBefore his disappearance in 1989, Major Garland Briggs left a secret message for his son Bobby hidden in his living room chair, containing instructions for him to visit a childhood haunt on a certain day twenty-five years later. The symbol appeared above a representation of one of the two mountains around Twin Peaks, below a red crescent.\nDale Cooper's doppelganger carried a scuffed ace of spades playing card with this symbol in place of the spade. Before killing his associate Darya, he showed it to her, explaining that the symbol was what he wanted.\nBehind the scenes\nThe symbol superficially resembles the one found in Owl Cave and on Teresa Banks' ring, which features a central diamond flanked by two peaks."}
