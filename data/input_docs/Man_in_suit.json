Explaining that he was calling \"about insurance,\" the man repeatedly asked for Truman, and was bewildered when Lucy Brennan said that there were two, one of whom was sick while the other was gone fishing. Finally, the man awkwardly offered Lucy his business card and rushed out, saying he would call another day."}
