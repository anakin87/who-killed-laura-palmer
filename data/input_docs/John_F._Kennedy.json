Kennedy was a President of the United States during the 1960s until his assassination in 1963.\nBiography\nKennedy was known to have expressed an interest in outer space and the phenomenon of UFOs.\nOn November 22, 1963, Kennedy was assassinated at Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas. Although Lee Harvey Oswald was charged with the crime, doubts clouded the circumstances of Kennedy's murder. Shortly after the shooting, three tramps were arrested but released shortly after, with their arrest records later being lost. In 1967, New Orelans District Attorney Jim Garrison arrested Clay Shaw for conspiring to kill Kennedy, but Shaw was acquitted.\nIn 1973, Dale Cooper began to express doubts over Oswald acting alone. At this time, he believed Kennedy to have been shot by a man concealing a gun inside of an umbrella and that the assassination was connected to the death of Marilyn Monroe. Cooper expressed such thoughts again in 1987 and 1989.\nIn 1991, Oliver Stone released the film JFK, which focused upon Shaw's trial.\nBehind the scenes\nJohn Fitzgerald Kennedy (May 29, 1917 \u2013 November 22, 1963) was the 35th President of the United States, serving from 1961 until his assassination in 1963.\nAlthough official investigations into Kennedy's assassination have found Lee Harvey Oswald to be solely responsible, his death has been the subject of various conspiracy theories."}
