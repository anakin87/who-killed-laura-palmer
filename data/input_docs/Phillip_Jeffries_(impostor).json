A short conversation ensued:\nCooper: \"Phillip?\"Voice: \"You're late.\"\"Couldn't be helped.\"\"I missed you in New York. I see you're still in Buckhorn.\"\"And you're still nowhere, is that correct?\"\"You met with Major Garland Briggs.\"\"How did you know that? Phillip?\"\"Actually, I just called to say goodbye.\"\"This is Phillip Jeffries, right?\"\"You're going back in tomorrow, and I will be with BOB again.\"\"Who is this?\"\nRay later stated that he had been ordered to kill Cooper by someone calling himself Phillip Jeffries, who had then arranged with Ray and prison warden Dwight Murphy to set Cooper up after they were released from Yankton Federal Prison. This person had also instructed Ray to then place a ring on Cooper's hand, as he had something inside him that \"they\" wanted.\nWhen confronted, the real Jeffries did not appear to remember speaking to Cooper on the night in question, leading Cooper to suspect it had been someone else.\nBehind the scenes\nThe voice's identity is not disclosed. There is no actor credited for the voice performance in Part 2, possibly suggesting that it is another credited actor."}
