I tell what I can to form the perfect answer. But that answer cannot come before all are ready to hear, so I tell what I can to form the perfect answer. Sometimes my anger at the fire is evident. Sometimes it is not anger, really \u2013 it may appear as such, but could it be a clue? The fire I speak of is not a kind fire.\"\n \u2015Margaret Lanterman\nMen sing and clap, disturbing the sleep of Agent Cooper, who makes a voice note to Diane that he has been awakened at 4 AM and asks her to send him earplugs.\nCooper enters the dining room as the singing continues and the waitress tells him the men are a business junket from Iceland.

She told him that people were sick and rotten. Jacoby asks if Laura had a terrible secret, and says that she wanted to corrupt people. Bobby admits that Laura made him sell drugs.\nThe officers walk through the woods and a raven watches them. Hawk tracks a path to a cabin, but Cooper says it is the wrong cabin. Harry advises Doctor Hayward to hang back. The Log Lady greets them on the porch and she offers them tea and cookies. She says the owls will not see them inside. She says her log saw something significant. She says that her husband was a lumberman and that he had met the devil and Harry says this occurred the day after the wedding. She interprets the log: it saw two men and two girls and heard some screaming.\nThe men go farther through the woods and find the cabin from the picture. They sneak up on it: a record player is playing \"Into the Night\" on vinyl, making Cooper remark that \"there is always music in the air\" and they find Waldo in a bird cage. Some twine is on the floor along with a bloodstain. A poker chip rolls out of the cuckoo clock: it is missing a piece of the same shape as was found in Laura's stomach.\nThe Martells enter the gala for the men from Iceland.

She shoots him and the ceiling light swings back and forth as he retreats.\nCooper walks down the hallway to the sound of men singing and notices the door to his room is ajar.
