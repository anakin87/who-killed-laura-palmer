Business-minded, the mill absorbed the Martell Mill during his leadership.\nBiography\nLittle is known about Packard's life before fathering his son, Andrew in 1910 or 1911.\nIn October 1914, a knife fight ensued \u2013 allegedly over a girl \u2013 between Packard and two other men, Ersel Martell and Jean Jacques Renault, leaving Packard severely injured. After his recovery, Packard married Minnie Drixel, who has been rumored to be the girl involved with the fight.\nBy 1922, Packard inherited his family's sawmill, which he razed that year and built a much larger mill in its place, which flourished after he bought a v-shaped flume invented by Crosby Truman. During this time, Packard also lived in the Blue Pine Lodge.\nIn the spring of 1933, Zebulon Martell signed over to Packard the Martell Mill, which was subsequently closed by Packard in 1939.\nBehind the scenes\nPackard was first mentioned in Twin Peaks: Access Guide to the Town as Ezekial Packard. However, he was renamed Thomas in The Secret History of Twin Peaks."}
