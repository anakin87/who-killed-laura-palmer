{"name": "Red", "url": "https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Red", "text": "Red\nRed was an international drug dealer looking to operate in Twin Peaks.\nBiography\nAs of September 2016, Red had been around the Twin Peaks area for \"the last couple of weeks.\"\nAt the Roadhouse one evening, he appeared to finish a conversation with Jean-Michel Renault, and then made eye contact with Shelly Briggs across the room and acknowledged her with a flirtatious gun gesture. At some point, likely in the few weeks prior to this interaction, the two had begun seeing each other.\nOne morning, Red met with Richard Horne and discussed with him the trafficking of a drug called \"Sparkle\" down from Canada. \nHe asked Richard if he had ever studied his hand and stated that he had a liver problem that made him stamp his foot. Red then asked about The King and I and threatened Horne to not double-cross him. Red then performed a \"magic\" trick with a coin that hung in the air then appeared in Richard's mouth before returning to Red.\nRed later visited Shelly at the Double R Diner and they planned to meet later at the \"same place\" (possibly the Roadhouse).\nIn a Q&A, Mark Frost stated that warrants were eventually issued for Red's arrest, but \"as of this writing\" he remained at large."}
