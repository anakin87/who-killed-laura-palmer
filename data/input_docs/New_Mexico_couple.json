One of them approached the car and the man opened his door slightly, transfixed, as an electrical hum filled the air. The man, looking like a pitch-black disheveled vagrant and holding a cigarette, leaned in the window and repeatedly asked \"Gotta light?\" The woman began screaming as another of the woodsmen leered at her, and eventually the man sped away, narrowly avoiding another of the figures as it stepped out of the darkness."}
