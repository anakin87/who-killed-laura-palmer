Noticing that they were dressed in short skirts, he asked them if they were \"looking for trouble of a boy nature.\"\nAs the girls left, Laura told Morrissey that they had met three Canadian boys and wanted him to point them in the girls' direction if they showed up at the Book House.\nBehind the scenes\nMorrissey appears in one scene of the original script of Twin Peaks' pilot episode, in which he is described as the owner of the Roadhouse and Hemingway's, presumably an early version of the Book House. In the scene, which takes place at Hemingway's, Morrissey cleans an espresso machine as Donna comes and asks him if he has seen James Hurley.\nMorrissey is also mentioned by Sheriff Harry S. Truman in an outtake from the pilot, describing him as the owner of the Book House and the Roadhouse."}
