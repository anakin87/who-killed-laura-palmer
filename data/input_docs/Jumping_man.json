The man wore a red suit, similar to that worn by the arm, and a plaster mask with a long spike for a nose. In his right hand the man held a small tree branch.\nBiography\nThe man was present at a meeting above a convenience store between the arm and BOB, where he jumped on and off a plastic crate while making a screeching noise.\nWhen Dale Cooper's doppelganger asked to see Phillip Jeffries at the convenience store, one of the woodsmen turned a lever on a device, causing an electrical discharge. The jumping man briefly appeared in the room, violently animated.\nThe man later rushed down a staircase after Dale Cooper and Mike walked up the stairs on their way to visit Phillip Jeffries.\nBehind the scenes\nThe \"jumping man\" appears in Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me and the 2017 revival, portrayed by Carlton Lee Russell. The shooting script of Fire Walk with Me makes no mention of this character during the Lodge meeting scene.\nIn the featurette, \"Moving Through Time: Fire Walk with Me Memories\", actor Carlton Lee Russell says, \"David told me that my character was this talisman come to life.\" The footage shifts from his interview to that of Mrs. Tremond's grandson hopping around like a bird outside the Red Diamond City Motel.\nIn \"Part 15,\" the man's face is superimposed with the face of Grace Zabriskie, who plays Sarah Palmer. The accompanying audio, when slowed down, appears to be David Lynch repeating the words \"Keep going back, Michael,\" and variations thereof.\nThe jumping man as seen in \"Part 15\" appears in a composite image on the final page of Twin Peaks: The Final Dossier, along with BOB and the featured woodsman from \"Part 8.\""}
