The sound led Dale Cooper and Sheriff Harry S. Truman's party to the site, which they discovered had been visited by Laura Palmer the night of her murder.\nOn the night of March 9, she performed \"Rockin' Back Inside My Heart\" and \"The World Spins.\" During the second number, Cruise and her band seemed to disappear from the stage, replaced by the Giant issuing a warning to Dale Cooper. Only Cooper appeared to notice this incident.\nIn late 2016, she sang \"The World Spins\" once again.\nBehind the scenes\nThe \"Roadhouse Singer,\" also credited as \"Girl Singer\" and \"Singer,\" was portrayed by Julee Cruise. Twin Peaks: Access Guide to the Town revealed that the character is intended to be Julee Cruise herself. All of the songs she performed in the series appear on her 1989 album Floating into the Night, alongside \"Mysteries of Love,\" which was written for David Lynch's Blue Velvet. Each song's music was written by Angelo Badalamenti, with the lyrics by Lynch. Her song performed in Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (also written by Badalamenti and Lynch) was released on her 1993 album, The Voice of Love.\nCruise returned in the 2017 revival of Twin Peaks."}
