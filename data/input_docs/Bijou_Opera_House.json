Paderewski was also known to have performed at the opera house.\nThe Bijou also served as a venue for vaudeville acts, such as the Marx Brothers and W. C. Fields.\nIt became the town's first movie theater in 1925 with a double bill of Charlie Chaplin's The Gold Rush and Sergei Eisenstein's The Battleship Potemkin. It was also the first in town to be capable of screening talkie films. At a 1929 screening of The Jazz Singer, the town's last living Civil War veteran \"succumbed to a fatal rictus\" upon hearing Jolson singing in the film.\nThe Bijou's 1941 premiere of 49th Parallel was given credit for the town's rise in enlistment and the formation of the Citizens Brigade, later known as the Bookhouse Boys.\nIt was later abandoned until a controversial 1969 performance by Guess Who.\nIn 1982, Benjamin Horne restored the opera house according to the original architect's design and it began screening films once again."}
