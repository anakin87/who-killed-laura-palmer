He knocked on the door and the waitress resembling Laura opened it. After Dale introduced himself as an agent of the FBI, she asked if they had found \"him\". In response, he addressed her as Laura, which confused her. She told him her name is Carrie Page, but he insisted that she is Laura, and offered to take her home in Twin Peaks. Having already been needing to leave town, she agreed to go with him. As she got ready to leave, Cooper went inside, seeing a dead man on the couch and a white figurine of a horse. While they were leaving, a telephone rang in the house.\nGallery\nDead manHorse figurine over the fireplace.\nBehind the scenes\nThe shoot place is located in the southern California desert.
