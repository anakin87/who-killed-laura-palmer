We don't have any.\"\nIrene was a waitress at Hap's Diner in Deer Meadow, Washington.\nBiography\nFBI Agents Chester Desmond and Sam Stanley came to the diner before dawn in February 1988 to ask Irene about murdered teenager Teresa Banks, who previously worked at the diner. She told them that the girl was often late and had a cocaine problem. Desmond asked Irene if she ever used cocaine, to which she said she did not do any drugs. Irene also called Teresa's death a \"freak accident.\" She further told them that Teresa's left arm went numb three days before her death. Stanley then asked to order food and she warned that the diner does not have any specials.\nIrene left work later in the morning as Desmond and Stanley got into the former's car.\nBehind the scenes\nA cut line from the shooting script mentions that Irene is married to Jack, the owner of Hap's Diner."}
