On days where the Passion Play would take place, it would begin after dark among the trees in Glastonbury Grove. Six figures would appear, wielding swords, chrysanthemums, crucifixes, and chalices and a guardian would appear at a gate. The phenomenon would last through the night until sunlight, causing \"good\" to vanquish \"evil.\"\nThe Passion Play never occurred the night before a cloudy day. Rumor also persisted that the event was sponsored by the Bookhouse Boys.\nBehind the scenes\nThe illustrative picture is an extract from an 1847 caricature from le Magasin Pittoresque."}
