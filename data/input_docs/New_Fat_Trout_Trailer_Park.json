Another tenant, Kriscol, performed unpaid maintenance work at the park while selling his own plasma to make rent, until Rodd intervened and told him to start charging for his labor instead.\nSteven and Becky Burnett, a married couple living at the park, began having loud and abusive confrontations, disturbing the other residents. One day, Rodd witnessed Becky steal her mother Shelly's car, flinging Shelly off the hood when she tried to stop her. Alarmed, Rodd rode back into town with Shelly in Bill's van and helped her contact Becky's father Bobby.\nWhile walking his dog in the woods behind the trailer park, resident Cyril Pons encountered Steven, suicidal and brandishing a handgun, along with Gersten Hayward. Retreating in fear, Pons reported the matter to Carl, pointing out Steven's trailer.\nNotable residents\nBill\nSteven and Becky Burnett\nKriscol\nMickey and Linda\nCyril Pons\nCarl Rodd - owner, manager"}
