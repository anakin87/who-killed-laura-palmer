Tim was the one who stuffed animals.\nBiography\nIn early March 1989, Pete Martell had a fish taxidermied by Tim and Tom.\nAbout a week later, Pinkle demonstrated a Port-O-Patient for Bobby Briggs and Shelly Johnson, who wished to have one for the invalid Leo Johnson. However, the machine was shown to be unsafe. Tim then got in the machine and it went haywire as Bobby and Shelly left the room.\nAt the Stop Ghostwood campaign's fashion show, Pinkle presented the endangered pine weasel. Tim told Dick Tremayne that the weasel wanted to kiss him, but it ended up biting his nose, which ultimately caused chaos.\nA few days later, he choreographed the Miss Twin Peaks Contest.\nTrivia\nIn Twin Peaks: Access Guide to the Town, one of the players on the 1968 Twin Peaks High School football team is identified as Don Pinkle. It is unknown if he has any relation to Tim and Tom."}
