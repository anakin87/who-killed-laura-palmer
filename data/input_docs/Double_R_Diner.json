It was owned and operated by Norma Jennings from April 1969.\nOpen all days of the week and holidays, the Double R was a town institution and oftentimes a hang-out, specializing in homemade pie and coffee. It was also a food provider for the town through the Meals on Wheels program and a sponsor of the Miss Twin Peaks Contest.\nIt was later the flagship store of a franchise known as Norma's Double R.\nHistory\n\nFounding\n\n1980s\n\n2010s\nAfter crossing, Dale Cooper drove past the Double R with Carrie Page late one night.

For subsequent episodes of the original series, the diner interiors were recreated on a soundstage. The Mar-T sign was later explained in The Secret History of Twin Peaks as a holdover from the diner's original incarnation as Marty's Railroad Cafe, which was named after Norma's father.\nThe real cafe was gutted by a fire in 2000, and reopened with interior design that bore little resemblance to the Twin Peaks-era look.\nFor the 2017 limited series, Twede's Cafe was remodeled to restore the original Double R's appearance, with the renovations remaining after shooting had wrapped. Location filming at Twede's Cafe took place between September 14 and September 18, 2015.\nPlaying Lynch\n \nAn advertisement for the diner was used to tease David Lynch's project Playing Lynch before its official announcement.\nIt is interesting to note that the advertisement states the diner to have opened in 1984. However, this is impossible, as Norma stated in 1989 that she had been working there for 20 years.\nGallery\nThe diner as it appears in the April 28, 2017 teaser"}
