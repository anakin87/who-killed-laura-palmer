Edgar Hoover was a notable director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nBiography\nDuring the summer of 1968, Hoover received a letter from fourteen-year-old Dale Cooper, who told Hoover of his intention to one day join the FBI. In the letter, Cooper told Hoover about a \"purely scientific\" exploit of tape-recording a girls' sexual education class, and hoped it would not disqualify him.\nTo Cooper's awe, Hoover responded to the letter, congratulating him on his ingenuity and inviting him to Washington, D.C. to tour the Bureau headquarters and meet a Special Agent. Cooper and his father visited on July 15, bearing a pound cake prepared by Cooper's mother, which Hoover complimented. Before their tour, Dale posed for a picture next to Hoover, holding a Thompson submachine gun he claimed had been used to kill gangsters back in \"the good old days.\"\nAfter returning home from three years abroad in April 1973, Dale learned that Hoover had passed away.\nIn later years, the name \"J. Edgar\" was used as a euphemism for agents of the FBI.\nBehind the scenes\nJ. Edgar Hoover (January 1, 1895 \u2013 May 2, 1972) was the first Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, serving from the Bureau's establishment in 1935 until his death in 1972. Hoover is a controversial figure, due most to his secretive abuses of power."}
