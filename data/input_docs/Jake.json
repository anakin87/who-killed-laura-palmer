On Gene's signal, Jake sighted Jade's car through a rifle scope as she passed by, but was unable to see Cooper, as he was bent over in his seat. He reported to Gene that Jones was not with her, and agreed to rendezvous at Mikey's after Gene rigged Jones' car with a bomb.\nThat night, Jake sat with Gene outside the house, listening as Gene reported their situation to a furious Lorraine."}
