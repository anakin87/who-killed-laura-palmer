However, she learned the next year that it was actually a gift from Benjamin Horne after overhearing an argument between him and his own daughter, Audrey.\nLaura named the pony after one she saw in a photo book belonging to Mrs. Larkin.\nTroy was kept at the Broken Circle Stables, where he was given care by a stable worker named Zippy.\nLaura spent many of her days with Troy, but eventually felt that she was not worthy of him and decided to set him free in June 1986. He was found the following March, malnourished near railroad tracks, with a broken leg and missing three shoes. Horne was present when the border police shot the pony and he vowed to Laura that he would find who freed Troy."}
