{"name": "Bellhop", "url": "https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Bellhop", "text": "Bellhop\n\"Oh, Mr. Jeffries! ...oh, the shit, it come out of my ass...\"\nAn unidentified bellhop worked at the Palm Deluxe hotel in 1989.\nBiography\nThe bellhop carried Phillip Jeffries' suitcase when Jeffries arrived at the hotel in search of Judy.\nOn the way upstairs, the bellhop saw Jeffries disappear without explanation. A short time later, he reappeared with a loud report in a hotel stairwell right next to a maid and the terrified bellhop, who defecated himself. As Jeffries screamed and doubled over, the man inched forward and asked where Jeffries had gone, before screaming for help in Spanish.\nBehind the scenes\nThe subtitles for Twin Peaks: The Missing Pieces erroneously state that the bellhop screams \"are you the man?\" instead of \"ay\u00fadame.\""}
