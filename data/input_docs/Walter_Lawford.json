One evening, he went to the diner to share with Norma the profit reports of the Norma's Double R franchise. He also gave her business advice for the flagship diner, which she disagreed with, wishing to stick to her traditional practices.\nAfter interrupting a moment between Norma and Ed Hurley, Walter met with Norma at the diner and she told him that she was willing to have him buy out the franchise and leave her with her lone diner so she could remain with the family she had made there. Baffled, Walter told her she was making a mistake and left."}
