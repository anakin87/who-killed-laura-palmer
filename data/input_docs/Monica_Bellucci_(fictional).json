In one, which he described to Albert Rosenfield and Tammy Preston, Cole was on a case in Paris, France, when Bellucci and her friends invited him for coffee at a street cafe. When they sat down, Dale Cooper appeared nearby, but Cole was unable to see his face. Bellucci quoted an ancient text, saying \"We are like the dreamer who dreams, and then lives inside the dream.\" Troubled, she then asked: \"But who is the dreamer?\" Cole, growing extremely uneasy, followed Bellucci's gaze and looked behind him, where he saw himself as a younger man. Cole then experienced a half-forgotten incident in 1989, when Phillip Jeffries suddenly appeared at the FBI offices of Philadelphia and tried to explain something to him and Cooper."}
