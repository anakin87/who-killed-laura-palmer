Truman, Special Agent Dale Cooper, and Doctor Will Hayward, in the course of investigating the murder of Laura Palmer searched, for Jacques Renault's cabin, they stumbled upon the Log Lady's cabin. She invited them in for tea and cookies, stating they were two days late and that the owls will not see them inside. She told them about her husband, who was a logging man that \"met the devil\" in the form of fire the day after their wedding, to which Hawk commented that \"The wood holds many spirits.\" She said that her log saw something the night Laura was killed and presented it to Agent Cooper, who asked it what it saw. Margaret talked for it: \"my log\" described darkness, laughter, owls flying, two men, two girls, flashlights in the woods over the ridge, quiet, and then the footsteps of a man. Not long after, she alleged that the log heard the screams of a girl further up over the ridge.\n2016\nOn October 1, 2016, Log Lady passed away and the light inside her cabin went out. "}
