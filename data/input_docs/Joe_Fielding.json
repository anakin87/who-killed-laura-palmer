{"name": "Joe_Fielding", "url": "https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Joe_Fielding", "text": "Joe Fielding\nJoe Fielding was a coroner who conducted the autopsy of Laura Palmer.\nFollowing the murder of popular high school student Laura Palmer, Doctor Will Hayward could not bring himself to perform the autopsy, having delivered Laura. As a result, he had Fielding do it and assisted him.\nTrivia\nDoctor Hayward says that Fielding came from Fairvale to perform the autopsy. There is no actual Fairvale in the United States, and thus may be a reference to the fictional Californian town where Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho takes place, as well as the Robert Bloch novel it was based on."}
