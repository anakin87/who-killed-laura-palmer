He informed them of the FBI's investigation of Laura Palmer's murder and that it was believed to be linked to the murder of Teresa Banks the previous year, and the killer may have been a citizen of Twin Peaks. A curfew was put into effect for citizens under 18 years of age.\nBehind the scenes\nDespite the fact that there is no direct reference to the town hall in the pilot, in the original script the scene of the meeting takes place there.\nIn the original script of the pilot, the outside of the location is described as follows: \"The picturesque center of the town of Twin Peaks; a small, neatly manicured park with a pristine white gazebo its centerpiece. Fronting the park is the '30's-style streamlined, concrete and glass City Hall.\""}
