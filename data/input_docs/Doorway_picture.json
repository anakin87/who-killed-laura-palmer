It is explored by Laura in her dream. She \"enters\" the picture frame into a first room and makes her way into a second Room where Mrs. Chalfont points her to yet another room. She enters a third room where Mrs. Chalfont's grandson awaits in the dark. He snaps his fingers and the room is lit. The room then dissolves into the familiar red drapes and black and white zig-zag floor of the Black Lodge.\nGallery\nFirst RoomMrs. Chalfont in the second roomThe grandson in the third roomThe grandson in the third room"}
