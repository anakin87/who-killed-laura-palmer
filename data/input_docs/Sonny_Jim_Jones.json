Dougie appeared to be in a catatonic state and Sonny Jim gave him a thumbs-up in the morning and helped him sit down at the breakfast table and eat his pancakes.\nThe next evening, Dougie came to Sonny Jim's room and sat with him, playing with his clap-activated lamp until Sonny Jim's mother angrily called Dougie down.\nAfter Dougie brought Bradley and Rodney Mitchum an insurance payout for a hotel that burned down, the brothers bought Sonny Jim a gym set.\nLater, Dougie was hospitalized and slipped into a coma after sticking a fork in an electrical outlet. Sonny Jim and his mother sat at Dougie's bedside and Bushnell Mullins soon arrived, followed by the Mitchum brothers, who brought food for them.\nAfter Janey-E took Sonny Jim to the bathroom, they returned to find that Dougie was awake and much more alert. He took them to the Silver Mustang Casino, where he told them that he had to leave, but would return, albeit accidentally referring to Dougie in the third person. Sonny Jim watched as his mother \u2013 who had come to the realization that he was not Dougie \u2013 kiss him goodbye and thank him.\nSoon after, Dougie returned to the home and embraced Sonny Jim and Janey-E, who were overjoyed at his return.\nBehind the scenes\nDavid Lynch previously used the name \"Sonny Jim\" in his 1980 feature film The Elephant Man and his 2001 short film, Pierre and Sonny Jim."}
