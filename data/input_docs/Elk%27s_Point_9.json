A trucker sitting nearby attempted to proposition her. Although she rejected him multiple times and warned him that she would eat him, he persisted and made vulgar threats towards her. Sarah stood up and took her face off, revealing a giant hand with a swollen ring finger and a mouth suspended in the black void surrounding it. Sarah closed up her face and bit the man's jugular out with her teeth, killing him. She screamed in feigned terror, summoning the bartender, who asked in horror what had happened. Sarah insisted she had no idea, and said it was a mystery.\nWhile investigating the bizarre \"rewriting\" of history regarding Laura Palmer's demise, agent Tammy Preston uncovered police records on Sarah's run-in with the trucker at the bar earlier that year."}
