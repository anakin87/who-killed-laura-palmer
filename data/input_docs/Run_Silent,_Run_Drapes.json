She was hooked immediately and embraced the entire Dr. Amp lifestyle; she religiously followed the podcast in her office every night.\nBy late 2016, Nadine had bought herself a mail-order golden shovel, and a few more for people on her Christmas list, and installed one of the shovels like a holy relic in the display window of her drapery store. While driving by Run Silent, Run Drapes on one of his weekly nocturnal supply runs, Dr. Jacoby saw the spotlight golden shovel Nadine had proudly hanged in her store window and stopped by to visit his former client. She expressed her admiration for his program and he recounted the last time he had seen her seven years prior at a supermarket during a storm. The two shared a flirtatious glance."}
