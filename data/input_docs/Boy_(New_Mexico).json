As they were walking, she spotted a penny lying heads-up, and said it would bring her good luck.\nThe boy walked the girl home. She asked if he was still going out with Mary, and he said that was over, but he wasn't sad about it. She then asked if he lived near their school, and explained that she \"just knew.\" At her house, the boy asked if he could give her a kiss, and the girl, awkwardly, accepted, before saying good night and going inside."}
