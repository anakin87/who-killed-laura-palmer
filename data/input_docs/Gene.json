{"name": "Gene", "url": "https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Gene", "text": "Gene\nGene was a hitman hired by Lorraine to kill Dougie Jones.\nAfter Jones (actually Dale Cooper) and Jade left an empty house in Rancho Rosa Estates, Gene pulled up in front of the house and signalled his partner Jake that they would be driving by his position, but warned that he hadn't seen whether Jones was in the car with her or still inside. Jake reported back that he hadn't seen Jones in the car, and Gene instructed him to wait for him at Mikey's, and then discreetly planted a bomb on Jones' car.\nThat night, Gene called Lorraine to report that Jones still hadn't emerged from the house, although the lights were on. Lorraine screamed at them that Jones should have been killed yesterday, and now her own life would be in danger. Gene asked what she wanted them to do, but she screamed \"Fuck!\" and hung up."}
