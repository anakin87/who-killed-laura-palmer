Donna knocked on her door, and was bewildered to find that a different Mrs. Tremond now lived there, who said she had no living mother or children. The second Mrs. Tremond, however, gave Donna a letter addressed to her that had appeared in her mail the day after Harold killed himself, which contained a missing page from Laura Palmer's secret diary dated February 22 and February 23."}
