This is accomplished by collecting four Suspect Clue cards that match in poker suit and name (there are 50 in total), collecting twelve donut counters (there are 70 in total), and assembling the five points the Pentagram Deathtrap puzzle (there are 30 pieces divided into 6 sets on a perforated cardboard), thus \"trapping\" the suspect.\nThe playing pieces are:\ncolour\ntoken\nRed\nThe Heart\nBlue\nThe Pie\nGreen\nThe Poker Chip\nYellow\nThe Log\n(plays first)\nBlack\nThe Gun\nWhite\nThe Coffee Cup\nOnly five suspects have enough Suspect Cards to be trapped: Jacques Renault and Phillip M. Gerard have four, Leo Johnson and Leland Palmer have a few more cards and BOB has the most.\nMap of Twin Peaks\nAn original map of the town.\nA History of the Local Area\nIn 1887, the introduction of the locomotive opened the Cascade wilderness to the logging industry. Prior to this time the Chinook Indian tribes were among those Native Americans to precede the first white explorers Robert Gray and Lewis and Clark recognizing the beauty and opportunity of the Columbia River region. Places like the Twin Peaks locale were common to possess forests of fir pine, hemlock, and cedar so dense that they remained almost completely unexplored by man. Indeed, a man can still to this day, find himself quite easily lost after entering the Pacific Northwest woods after only a few dozen feet.\nThe Town of Twin Peaks\nPop. 51,201. Twin Peaks is located 5 miles south of the Canadian Border and 12 miles west of the state line in the Northeast portion of Washington State, near the Huckleberry Mountain Range. The economy is based on the conversion of wood and forestry products with many small cottage industries providing finished goods to support the area's many wood craftsmen, the minority of whom are of local Indian origins. From Seattle, travelling along 1-90; continue to State Road 21, then North into the Colville Indian Reservation and National Park areas. The twin tributaries of Deer Creek and the Kettle River converge upon the outskirts of the community to form Timber Falls jus below the Great Northern Hotel.\nTwin Peaks derives its name from the summits along the Huckleberry ridge, with Troublesome Peak standing at elevation 4,439 as the tallest of the two. High- way 21 connects at mid-town Twin Peaks with Sparkwood, but continues on some distance to Grand Forks, British Columbia across the Canadian border. Aside from the regional tribes of American Indians making up the population, the balance is a diversified grouping of Danes, Welsh and Dutch, along with small cluster of Irish mill workers who emigraled in the late 1800s, now residing along the river in low town.\nThe Darkness\nThere are many legends in American Indian lore about the deep woods. Things such as spirits and souls fill their religion and bear some consideration before casting such detailed accounts aside. Thankfully, there are protective attitudes in this otherwise sleepy town of Twin Peaks. Over the years stories of children found murdered in the woods have prompted the formation of a secret society chartered to keop the DARKNESS at bay, and has been in effect over the Course of many generations. The DARKNESS is an expression of the very presence of evil, the black nature of the forces of life. On one hand it is a natural force, yet on the other, it endeavours to confound and divert every attempt to civilize society. The DARKNESS is a disorganiaing element which bears watching for it may rear its head at any given moment however sacred, claiming back that which it jealously reveres as its own. Attempts to push back the deep shroud of the DARKNESS over the years have only caused it to harbour a greater determination to take humanity down with it, for it has shown a cunning, palience, and perversion to be compared to the instincts of certain beasts af prey stealing away the frail and the young. The DARKNESS is sometimes explained in local lore by the phrase: \"The Owls are not what they seem!\"\nPersonality Profiles\nDr. JacobyJosie PackardBlackieJerry HornePhillip M.
