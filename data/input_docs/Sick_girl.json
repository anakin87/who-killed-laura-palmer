She's sick!\"\n \u2015Her guardian\nAn unidentified sick girl was caught in a traffic jam outside the Double R Diner after a boy fired a gun out of his car.\nThe girl and a woman were driving to make a 6:30 dinner with the girl's uncle, whom she hadn't seen in a long while, when they were stalled. As the woman was shouting at Bobby Briggs to clear the road, the girl convulsed and leaned over toward the open driver-side window, vomiting a green liquid, which caused the woman to start screaming."}
