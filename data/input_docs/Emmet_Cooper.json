By April of the following year, Dale and Emmet's mother told Dale that his brother had moved to Canada to become a lumberjack, and wouldn't return until he had chopped down all the trees there. In reality, Emmet was attempting to avoid being drafted for the Vietnam War. In November 1969, Emmet was forced to miss their mother's funeral, as he would risk imprisonment were he to return to the United States.\nOn learning that Dale had been accepted into the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Emmet wrote to him to call him a \"tool of the establishment,\" adding that he would \"rot in hell.\" Dale remarked in a tape recording that it was good to hear from him.\nIn July 1988, Dale attempted to locate Emmet in Alberta, Canada, but learned there that he was now in South America. He lamented to Diane Evans that he had not seen his brother in twenty years, but accepted that their lives had simply set them on different paths.\nBehind the scenes\nAccording to Scott Frost, the character of Emmet was a last-minute addition to The Autobiography of F.B.I. Special Agent Dale Cooper: My Life, My Tapes, which itself could have been linked to the original plans for the third season of Twin Peaks, had the show not been canceled. Mark Frost remarked that actor Roger Rees would have been \"a great older brother for Dale.\""}
