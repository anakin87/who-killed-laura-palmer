Cooper put the response and photo next to his poster of Jimmy Stewart in The FBI Story and charged a dime for people to see them. However, he ceased when his father stated that Zimbalist would disapprove.\nBehind the scenes\nEfrem Zimbalist Jr. (November 30, 1918 \u2013 May 2, 2014) was an American actor. In The Autobiography of F.B.I. Special Agent Dale Cooper: My Life, My Tapes, Cooper states that he is a fan of Zimbalist's show, but the title is not given. However, it can be assumed that he was referring to the television series, The F.B.I., in which Zimbalist appeared in one of his most notable roles."}
