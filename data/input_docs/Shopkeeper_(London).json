When Freddie left the money on the counter and ran away, the shopkeeper ran after him; Freddie wore the glove and punched the shopkeeper without thinking about it, snapping his neck. While narrating the story to James Hurley, Freddie described the shopkeeper as a \"jobsworth\", \"a person who delights in acting in an obstructive or otherwise unhelpful manner, as in, 'I can't do that, it's more than my job's worth.'\""}
