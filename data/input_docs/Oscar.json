Sarah was suddenly disturbed by the Albatross turkey jerky in the stand behind her, and asked when it had arrived. She told Victoria that her room looked different, and that \"men\" were coming. Confused, Victoria asked her what was wrong, and Sarah became visibly distressed, saying that she didn't feel good and then forcing herself to leave the store. Oscar half-heartedly suggested he could deliver her groceries as he knew where she lived."}
