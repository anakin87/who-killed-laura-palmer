They bring him to their location and he says he is there to see Ray. He is told that Renzo is the leader of the men, as he is undefeated in arm-wrestling. The doppelganger likens this practice to children's games and challenges Renzo, wagering Ray. After much toying with his opponent, the doppelganger wins, then kills him with a brutal punch to the face. \n \nAs the group' new leader, he is granted his request to be alone with Ray who \u2013 after being shot in the leg \u2013 tells him the details of his contract from Phillip Jeffries to kill the doppelganger. He reveals Jeffries sent him after the doppelganger as he has \"something inside\" that he wants. Ray takes out the green ring, saying that he was supposed to put it on him after killing him. Ray says a mysterious prison guard gave it to him before he was released; he is instructed to put it on. Meanwhile, Richard Horne joins the group as they watch Ray hand over the coordinates.

Meanwhile, Sinclair comes to see the two detectives he's been committing fraud with looking for poison.\nHutch and Chantal drive, discussing Mormons.\nJaney-E takes Cooper to work in the new car. Sinclair waits nervously for \"Dougie\" and takes him to get coffee. After taking a sip, Cooper wanders over to observe the shop's pie as Sinclair laces his coffee.
