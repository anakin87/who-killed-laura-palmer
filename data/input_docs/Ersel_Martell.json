After Renault fled, Martell stood trial for the incident and spent three years at the Washington State Penitentiary.\nMartell returned to town after his sentence and married Bessie Spoon, with whom he had Pete Martell before dying of food poisoning.\nBehind the scenes\nMartell was first mentioned in Twin Peaks: Access Guide to the Town as Nealith Martell, who inherited the Martell Mill after his father's death and was largely incompetent, which led to his being forced to sell the mill to the Packards. However, in The Secret History of Twin Peaks, he was renamed Ersel and never inherited the mill, as his father sold it on his deathbed."}
