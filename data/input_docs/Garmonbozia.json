Is it a symbol for something else?\"\n \u2015Margaret Lanterman\n \nGarmonbozia was a substance that resembled, or indeed was, creamed corn. The term \"garmonbozia\" was synonymous with \"pain and sorrow.\" It was a source of sustenance for certain spirits, including the arm.\nWhile sitting at a formica table above a convenience store with BOB, the arm smiled at several bowls and plates of creamed corn sitting before him, identifying them as garmonbozia.\nPhillip Gerard, a host for the spirit Mike, accused BOB's host Leland Palmer of stealing \"corn\" that he had \"canned over the store.\"\nAfter killing Laura Palmer, BOB and Leland appeared in the red room before Gerard and the arm, both of whom demanded, in unison: \"Bob, I want all my garmonbozia.\" In response, BOB held his hand to Leland's stomach wound, causing it to disappear, and then threw a great amount of blood onto the floor. Moments later, the arm ate a spoonful of creamed corn.\nBehind the scenes\nIn the original shooting script of Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, the term \"garmonbozia\" appears in the final scene featuring BOB and the arm inside the red room; and also in the scene where the arm first appears in the movie while seated in front of BOB. The phrase in the script is simply \"garmonbozia (corn)\" \u2013 the clarification that the word refers to \"pain and sorrow\" appears only in the finished film, and then only in the on-screen subtitles.\nCreamed corn features in several scenes, notably in the introduction of Mrs. Tremond and Pierre in \"Episode 9.\" The name \"garmonbozia\" only appears in Fire Walk with Me.\nThe name may be inspired by ambrosia, the food that was said to sustain the ancient Greek gods' immortality."}
