She said that Megan needed to stop taking drugs and visiting the \"nut house,\" and sarcastically asked where she had shoplifted her sweater. Megan, annoyed, responded that it was Paula's. Next, Sophie asked if Megan had seen Billy recently, and she told Sophie about an incident where he had run into her house bleeding, scaring Megan and her mother. Sophie pointedly asked Megan what her mother's name was again, and she replied that her mother was Tina. They were interrupted by the MC announcing Lissie's performance."}
