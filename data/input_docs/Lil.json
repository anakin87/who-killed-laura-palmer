{"name": "Lil", "url": "https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Lil", "text": "Lil\nLil was a woman identified by Gordon Cole as his cousin, who through a particular interpretive dance briefed Chester Desmond on what to expect during his investigation into the death of Teresa Banks.\nBiography\nFollowing the murder of Teresa Banks in February 1988, Lil danced for Special Agents Chester Desmond and Sam Stanley at a private airport in Portland. The dance served as a briefing for them: \nShe wore a sour face, meaning that Desmond would have problems with the local authorities; they would not be receptive to the FBI.\nBoth of her eyes were blinking, which meant that there would be trouble higher up.\nShe had one hand in her pocket, meaning local authorities were hiding something.\nHer other hand was made into a fist, indicating that the local authorities were likely to be belligerent and aggressive.\nShe is walking in place meaning that there would be a lot of legwork involved in the investigation.\nCole stated that Lil was his \"mother's sister's girl.\" Missing in that sentence was the word \"uncle\"; this was then elaborated on when Cole placed four fingers in front of his eyes like prison bars. This meant that the sheriff's uncle was in prison.\nHer dress had been tailored (with different-colored thread) to fit Lil, this being a code for drugs being involved with the investigation.\nPinned to the dress was a blue rose.\nTrivia\nBy pure coincidence, Lil's actress, Kimberly Ann Cole, shares her surname with Gordon Cole."}
