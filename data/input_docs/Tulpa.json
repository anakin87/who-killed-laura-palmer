{"name": "Tulpa", "url": "https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Tulpa", "text": "Tulpa\nTulpas were conjured duplicates of individuals. The tulpas were manufactured from a seed and organic material from the template \u2013 such as hair \u2013 and they could retain memories from their templates.\nHistory\nTulpas existed of Lois Duffy, Diane Evans, and Dale Cooper.\nDuffy's tulpa was killed by the original Lois Duffy in 1975 and it disappeared.\nEvans' tulpa was created at a \"gas station\" by Cooper's doppelganger in the early 1990s. In 2016, she assisted the FBI in investigating the disappearance of Cooper and his apparent resurgence (the doppelganger passing himself off as the original Cooper). She received various messages from the doppelganger during this time until growing distressed and drawing a gun on agents Albert Rosenfield, Tammy Preston, and Deputy Director Gordon Cole. However, she was shot dead by the agents and was transported to the red room, where she disintegrated.\nCooper had two tulpas, both known as Dougie Jones. The first was created as late as 1997 as part of a ploy by Cooper's doppelganger to stay out of the Black Lodge. During his existence, he was married to Janey-E Jones and had a son, Sonny Jim Jones. In 2016, he disintegrated in the red room after being transported there instead of the doppelganger. The second Dougie Jones was created by Mike, under instruction from Dale Cooper \u2013 who had taken Jones' place in a catatonic state for several days \u2013 and he returned to Janey-E and Sonny Jim.\nBehind the scenes\nThe \"tulpa\" is a concept from certain Indian and Tibetan schools of Buddhism, later adopted by theosophists during the twentieth century."}
