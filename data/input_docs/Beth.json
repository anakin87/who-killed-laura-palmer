As of 1989, she lived in Missoula, Montana.\nOn the morning of March 11, Beth called Leland Palmer, concerned that her daughter Maddy had not returned home from Twin Peaks as she had planned. Leland said he had driven her to the bus station himself, and promised to call her back within the hour.\nPresumably, Beth shared her daughter's surname, \"Ferguson.\" It is not stated whether Beth is Sarah's sister or sister-in-law.\nThe script for \"Episode 2\" identifies Maddy's father as \"Donald,\" although in the scene it is unclear, between Sarah and Leland, to whom Donald is related."}
