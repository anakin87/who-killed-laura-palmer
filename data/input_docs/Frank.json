Apologetically, Phil Bisby explained that Dougie had \"really wanted it,\" and offered a spare green tea latte instead. Tentatively, Frank tried a sip and then, amazed, drank effusively, grinning from ear to ear while Phil and Anthony Sinclair watched in bemusement.\nBehind the scenes\nFrank was portrayed by Bob Stephenson, who previously appeared in an uncredited role as a Double R Diner cook in \"Episode 6\" of Twin Peaks."}
