{"name": "London", "url": "https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/London", "text": "London\nLondon was a city in England, and the birthplace of Freddie Sykes.\nLocations\n\nEast End\nAfter spending a night in a pub drinking with his peers in 2016, Freddie Sykes had an epiphany in the corner of an alley. He climbed upon a stack of boxes and jumped, and was transported through a vortex in a void, where he received instructions from a man who called himself \"the Fireman.\"\nThe following day, following the Fireman's instructions, Freddie entered a nearby hardware store to buy a single green gardening glove. Freddie tried to purchase the glove, in spite of the shopkeeper's resistance due to the packaging being already open. Freddie paid for the glove anyway and left the shop, which caused the shopkeeper to run after him. Freddie wore the glove and punched the shopkeeper without thinking, breaking his neck. Freddie was unable to remove the glove in any way whatsoever; when a doctor tried to take the glove off, Freddie's hand started to bleed.\nActing according to the Fireman's plan, Freddie decided to go to Twin Peaks, Washington in the United States, and found out that his ticket had already been purchased for him."}
