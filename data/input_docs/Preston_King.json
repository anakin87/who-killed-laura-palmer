He brought in a supply of drugs to frame Agent Cooper and Niles went to the casino with Hank Jennings. King expressed his doubt in Niles, finding him to be too nervous.\nAt a drug buy at Dead Dog Farm with Ernie and a buyer from Seattle, smoke emitted from Ernie's shirt, revealing him to have been wearing a wire. King and Renault held the men at gunpoint until Agent Cooper came, offering himself in exchange for the two.\nLater, King watched as the farmhouse was surrounded by lawmen, suggesting that he and Renault run. Wishing to diffuse the situation, he saw a woman dressed as a waitress approach the house. She \u2013 DEA agent Denise Bryson \u2013 was allowed entry and subdued King while providing a gun to Cooper, which was used to kill Renault.\nBehind the scenes\nKing was played by Gavan O'Herlihy, the son of Dan O'Herlihy, who played Andrew Packard.\nThe character's name is derived from the radio and television series, Challenge of the Yukon, later retitled Sergeant Preston of the Yukon. The name 'Preston' is taken from the series' protagonist, Sgt. Frank Preston, and 'King' from his Alaskan husky sidekick, Yukon King."}
