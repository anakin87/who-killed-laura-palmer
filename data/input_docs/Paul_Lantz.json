Smith, and Military Intelligence officers Captain Davidson and Lieutenant Brown.\nLater that night, a B-25 carrying Davidson and Brown crashed. Lantz was informed by the anonymous source that the aircraft had been either sabotaged or shot. Lantz relayed this information to Crisman. As Lantz penned an article about the crash, Crisman informed Arnold and Smith, who summoned Lantz to the hotel.\nHe informed them of his impending article and told them that the anonymous caller would only stay on the line for thirty seconds or less and that the military had sealed off the crash site.
