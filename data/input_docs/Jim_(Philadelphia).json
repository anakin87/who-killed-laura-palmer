{"name": "Jim_(Philadelphia)", "url": "https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Jim_(Philadelphia)", "text": "Jim (Philadelphia)\nJim was a digger who worked alongside Dale Cooper during the summer of 1973.\nBiography\nCooper surmised that Jim had once been in prison, based on a tattoo he had on his forearm.\nThe two first worked together for eight hours on June 10. However, they did not speak to each other at all during this time.\nTwo days later, Cooper lost ten dollars to Cooper, throwing knives. Cooper asked him if he practiced Zen, to which Jim responded that he practiced staying alive.\nOn June 17, Cooper accompanied Jim to his apartment, where he kept boxes of notes that he referred to as his \"remembrances,\" that he kept so that someone would know about them. Jim then told Cooper that he had dug a good hole that day and that he should leave before anyone had their suspicions about what they were doing.\nAfter having an epiphany as to the meaning of the visit to the apartment, Cooper returned later in the night. However, by the time he arrived, the apartment had completely burned alongside several others. Jim's body was not found in the aftermath, although nobody reported seeing him leave. Cooper then saw a shadow of a man in an alley and heard laughter come from it. Nevertheless, upon investigating the alley, Cooper found only a sharpened pencil, which he suspected to be a message."}
