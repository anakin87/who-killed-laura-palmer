One evening, he was at work, watching the box and after changing the SD card in a camera that filmed the box, he got a delivery of coffee from Tracey. She asked to go back into the room with him, but with a security guard present, he told her she could not. When he went back in, he caught her trying to look over his shoulder as he entered the door code on a keypad.\nHe received another delivery from her not long after, and this time, the security guard was not anywhere to be seen, so Sam took Tracey into the room with him. After a few moments of watching the box and drinking their coffee, they began to make out. As they began to engage in sex, a ghostly figure appeared in the box and broke through to relentlessly slaughter them."}
