{"name": "Trucker", "url": "https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Trucker", "text": "Trucker\nAn unidentified trucker visited the Elk's Point #9 bar in Twin Peaks, Washington.\nOne night in 2016, he was drinking alone in the bar. Upon noticing Sarah Palmer, he approached her and began propositioning her; although she rejected him multiple times and warned him that she would eat him, he persisted and made vulgar threats towards her. Sarah stood up and took her face off, revealing a giant hand with a swollen ring finger and a mouth suspended in the black void surrounding it. Sarah closed up her face and bit the man's jugular out with her teeth, killing him.\nIn another 2016, a similar accident was reported to happen, with Sarah Palmer being the witness of a bizarre sudden death at the Elk's Point #9, when the trucker reportedly fell down with half of his throat torn out."}
