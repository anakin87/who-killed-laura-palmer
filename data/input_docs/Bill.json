The trailer park's owner Carl Rodd went into town to people-watch most mornings. On one of these occasions, Carl was joined by Mickey, who was going to pick up his wife Linda's mail.\nOn another day, Carl found Shelly Briggs lying on the ground, her car having just been stolen by her daughter Becky. He blew a pan flute to summon Bill, who drove the two back to the Double R Diner. On the way, Carl used Bill's two-way radio to contact Shelly's ex-husband Bobby on her behalf."}
