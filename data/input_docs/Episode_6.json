Yet there are those who open many eyes. 'Eyes are the mirror of the soul,' someone has said, so we look closely at the eyes to see the nature of the soul. Sometimes when we see the eyes \u2013 those horrible times when we see the eyes \u2013 eyes that have no soul, then we know a darkness. Then we wonder: where is the beauty? There is none, if the eyes are soulless.\"\n \u2015Margaret Lanterman\nCooper gently rejects Audrey's advances, stating that while she is very desirable, she needs a friend more than anything.
