{"name": "Davis", "url": "https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Davis", "text": "Davis\nDavis was a United States Air Force colonel.\nBiography\nTwenty-five years after the death of Major Garland Briggs, Davis was informed by Lieutenant Cynthia Knox that there was a match made to Briggs' fingerprints in Buckhorn, South Dakota; the sixteenth match since the Major's death. Although skeptical due to the previous fifteen matches, Davis informed Knox that if the match was accurate, that they must report it to the FBI.\nFrom South Dakota, Knox reported to Davis that the prints came from Briggs' body, but the head was missing and the body was the wrong age. Nevertheless, Davis made the call to the FBI. He reached Agent Tammy Preston, who put Deputy Director Gordon Cole on the line. After the hard-of-hearing Cole briefly misheard the word \"Buckhorn,\" Davis informed him about the situation.\nBehind the scenes\nHis name may be a reference to Don S. Davis, who played Major Garland Briggs in the original series.\nDavis wears US pins on his lapels, which is appropriate for a USAF officer.\nHe seems to have the following ribbons on his rack under his Command pilot wings insignia:\nLegion of Merit Ribbon\nBronze Star Ribbon\nDefense Meritorious Service Ribbon\n(with 1 Oak)\nMeritorious Service Ribbon\n(with 1 Oak)\nAerial Achievement Ribbon\n(with 1 Oak)\nJoint Service Commendation Ribbon\nAir Force Commendation Ribbon\n(with 1 Oak)\nAir Force Achievement Ribbon\nJoint Meritorious Unit Award Ribbon\nAir Force Meritorious Unit Award Ribbon\n(with 1 Oak)\nAir Force Outstanding Unit Award Ribbon\n(with \"V\" Device & 3 Oaks)\nAir Force Organizational Excellence Award Ribbon\n(with 2 Oaks)\nNational Defense Service Ribbon\n(with 1 Star)\nArmed Forces Expeditionary Ribbon\n(with 1 Star)\nGlobal War on Terrorism Expeditionary Ribbon\nGlobal War Terrorism Service Ribbon\nArmed Forces Service Ribbon\nHumanitarian Service Ribbon\n(with 3 Stars)\nAir Force Overseas Long Service Ribbon\n(with 1 Oak)\nAir Force Expeditionary Service Ribbon\n(with gold frame and 1 Bronze Oak)\nAir Force Longetivity Service Ribbon\n(with 3 Oak)\nSmall Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon\nAir Force Training Ribbon"}
