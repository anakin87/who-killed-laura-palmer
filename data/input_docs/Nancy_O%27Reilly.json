Her and Blackie didn't get a long and she wanted Nancy to go back North, presumably where she hailed from. \nWith Jean, she plotted to kill her sister.\nShe later encountered Dale Cooper, who restrained her and commanded her to take him to Audrey Horne. She did so and drew a knife when he went to the bed. She prepared to stab him, but he subdued her.\nWhen asked on Twitter if it can be assumed that Nancy is still planning revenge against Cooper for killing Jean Renault, Galyn G\u00f6rg replied \"Yes.....!!!!!! \ud83d\udc60\ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\ude0a\".\nBehind the scenes\nAlthough Galyn G\u00f6rg is credited in \"Episode 8\", she doesn't appear."}
