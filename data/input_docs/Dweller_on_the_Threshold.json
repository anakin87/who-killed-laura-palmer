{"name": "Dweller_on_the_Threshold", "url": "https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Dweller_on_the_Threshold", "text": "Dweller on the Threshold\nThe Dweller on the Threshold, also known as the \"shadow self,\" was a concept found in the stories of the Nez Perce tribe indigenous to the Twin Peaks region.\nIn the stories of the Black Lodge, the Dweller on the Threshold represented the sum total of a person's dark, negative, unresolved qualities at the time of their death. At the moment of a person's enlightenment, the dweller would appear and confront them, forcing them to vanquish it in order to pass through. Facing the dweller was the final test faced by all spirits on the way to perfection.\nDeputy Hawk explained the legend of the Dweller to Special Agent Dale Cooper while expounding on the myths of the White and Black Lodges, which Cooper in turn mentioned in one of his tapes to secretary Diane Evans.\nMany years later, Special Agent Tammy Preston summarized the legend in a report for Gordon Cole. Despite her initial assumption that the dweller was simply a metaphorical concept, she pondered whether the double of Agent Cooper they had encountered might literally have been the \"Dweller on the Threshold.\""}
