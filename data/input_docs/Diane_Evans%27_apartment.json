He questioned Diane about FBI activities since he had been gone. They kissed, but Diane, initially happy to see him, immediately sensed he was not himself. The doppelganger, sensing her fear, then raped her, after which she was taken to a \"gas station.\" An exact duplicate of Diane was created, which assumed her identity and apparently settled in her apartment.\nIn 2016, Albert Rosenfield reported to Gordon Cole he could not get a word in to Diane about Cooper before she cursed him out. Gordon and Albert met with Diane and a younger man at her apartment, where she coldly received them. Gordon explained they needed Diane to come to South Dakota to identify the imprisoned Cooper, as they suspected something is wrong with him. Diane reluctantly joined them.\nBehind the scenes\nThe establishing shot of the apartment's exterior is mirrored stock footage filmed at 264 Prospect Place, Brooklyn, New York. "}
