With his earphones on, he was oblivious to the arrival of a pitch-black woodsman, who grabbed the back of his head and began to crush his skull. While holding the disc jockey, the woodsman interrupted the broadcast and began repeating a mantra over and over. As he finished the last repetition, he strained and squeezed the man's head, finally caving in his skull and spilling blood and brain matter onto the floor."}
