{"name": "My_Prayer", "url": "https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/My_Prayer", "text": "My Prayer\n\"My Prayer\" was a song by the Platters.\nHistory\nOn the night of August 5, 1956, a disc jockey at KPJK in New Mexico played \"My Prayer,\" heard by a mechanic in town, a waitress at Pop's Diner, and Sarah Novack, who had just come home from a date. A woodsman wandered into the station and seized the DJ by the skull, knocking the stylus off the record and interrupting the song, before commandeering the station's signal to recite a poem.\nBehind the scenes\n\"My Prayer\" is a 1939 song, popularized in a hit single released by the Platters in 1956. The Platters' rendition features as a radio broadcast in \"Part 8\" and, non-diegetically, during Dale Cooper and Diane Evans' sex scene in \"Part 18.\" It appears as track 10 on Twin Peaks (Music From The Limited Event Series).\nLyrics\nWhen the twilight is gone and no songbirds are singingWhen the twilight is gone you come into my heartAnd here in my heart you will stay while I prayMy prayer is to linger with youAt the end of the day in a dream that's divineMy prayer is a rapture in blueWith the world far away and your lips close to mineTonight while our hearts are aglowOh tell me the words that I'm longing to knowMy prayer and the answer you giveMay they still be the same for as long as we liveThat you'll always be there at the end of my prayer\nCredits\nWritten by Georges Boulanger and Jimmy Kennedy\nPerformed by The Platters\nPublished by Skidmore Music Co.\nCourtesy of The Island Def Jam Music Group\nUnder license from Universal Music Enterprises"}
