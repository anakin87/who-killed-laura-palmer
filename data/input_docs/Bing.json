{"name": "Bing", "url": "https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Bing", "text": "Bing\nBing was one of Billy's acquaintances.\nOne night, Bing rushed into the Double R Diner and loudly asked if anyone had seen Billy, before running off.\nBehind the scenes\nBing is portrayed by Riley Lynch, the son of David Lynch and ex-wife and creative collaborator Mary Sweeney. Lynch also appears as part of the band Trouble in \"Part 5,\" apparently playing himself.\nThe closed captioning for \"Part 7\" erroneously indicates that the character asks for \"Bing,\" himself, when he enters the diner."}
