Hastings ran the site with town librarian Ruth Davenport. Heinrich Viegel was an occasional contributor.\nHistory\n \nThe blog was started on June 1, 1997. As early as 2010, visitors could leave comments in a guestbook, to which Hastings would occasionally respond. The last site update took place in November 2015.\nThe week before Ruth Davenport was found dead, Hastings left a post stating that the two of them had managed for the first time to enter \"the zone,\" where they made contact with \"the Major.\" Buckhorn police detective Dave Macklay provided a copy of the post to FBI investigator Albert Rosenfield.\nContents\n\nIntroduction\nWelcome to The Search for the Zone. Here you will find writings, links, and other bits and pieces as we find the time and inclination to post them up. This site is a journal of my (and my partner\u2019s) fascination with multidimensional/time travel, dark matter, the afterlife, etc. We are interested in a lot of things, but these are the main topics of discussion...\nWe will have to reconcile with the question that if someone from outside our familiar world gains access to our plane of existence, what ramifications will that entail? There might be forces at work from deep dimensional space, or from the future\u2026or are these one in the same? Think of the events that could have splintered time? The things that could have laid the seed for a starting point for this development? Perhaps technological innovations or the assassination of President Kennedy?\nA link below led to Hastings' older journal entries.\nReading links\nParallel Universes and Density Shifting\nhttp://www.grantchronicles.com/astro15.htm\nThe Science of Parallel Universes\nhttp://phys.org/news/2015-09-theory-parallel-universes-maths-science.html\nOn Electricity by Nikola Tesla\nhttp://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1897-01-27.htm\nThe Horizon Project\nhttp://www.thehorizonproject.com/\nWhy Frequencies are the Key to Understanding Parallel Universes and Time Travel (link takes you to another site)\nFred\u2019s Blog\nhttp://mishscifimusings.wordpress.com/\nEpoch Times article on Parallel Universes\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20130906031010/http://www.theepochtimes.com:80/n2/science/is-deja-vu-caused-by-parallel-universes-video-229364.html\nGreat article on Hugh Everett III\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hugh-everett-biography/\nThis is a little goofy, but always nice to see some local Buckhorn/Rapid City area lore\u2026after all this is the sacred lands of the Lakota\nhttp://rapidcityjournal.com/now/today/rcj/black-hills-ghost-stories/collection_9a079eda-799d-11e5-b74c-9b73ebaf901e.html#1\nHeinlein Links\nScience Fiction has been a source of enjoyment for me since I was ten years old, when I read Orphans of The Sky.\nRobert A.

In general though science is a very dogmatic field and not open to enquiry. What\u2019s funny is when it\u2019s reported that science has \u2018found something that shouldn\u2019t exist\u2019 as if the whole universe is governed by man made laws of physics. Thanks for all your work, Bill...those of us in the community commend and support you!\n12 Oct 11 03:01am\nJ. Garvey\nRecently I had an experience that can only be explained by the existence of multiple dimensions. It was not a dream of any kind or anything I had experienced in the past. Without going into too much detail, I found myself present\u2026physically present with a close friend who passed in some other \u2018space\u2019 or \u2018dimension.\u2019 He has been gone for several years but in this elsewhere where I found myself he existed in flesh form. I know this sounds impossible, but it happened, I swear. This has completely changed my concepts of \u2018life\u2019 and \u2018consciousness'\n12 Oct 11 08:06pm\nBill Hastings \nvery powerful stuff, John...\n07 Mar 14 04:53pm\nAdam Z.\nIts chemicals that change \nthe brain - we can do\nthis.
