Reverend Clarence Brocklehurst read a passage of scripture as FBI Agent Dale Cooper watched all of the attendees, particularly Bobby Briggs, while James Hurley watched from a distance. After Brocklehurst finished, Johnny Horne shouted \"Amen!\" which Bobby mockingly repeated, accusing the town of being full of hypocrites, as knew she was in trouble but did not help, incriminating them in her death. A fight between Bobby and James was quickly broken up as Leland Palmer jumped onto his daughter's coffin, and the crane raised and lowered him, much to his wife Sarah Palmer's dismay.\n \nThat evening, Cooper watched the new grave and saw Lawrence Jacoby \u2013 who was absent from the funeral \u2013 approaching with a garland of flowers. The psychiatrist admitted that he did not actually care about the problems of the townspeople, but Laura changed all that.\nThe following week, Donna Hayward visited Laura's grave to place a flower from Harold Smith and to vent her frustrations with Laura's problems still lingering in spite of her death.\nFollowing his death, Leland Palmer was buried at Black Lake.\nPeople interred at Black Lake\nGeorge McDowell\nLaura Palmer\nLeland Palmer\nBehind the scenes\nDespite the fact that there is no direct reference to the Black Lake Cemetery in original series, in the script the scene of the funeral takes place there.\nIn the original script of the third episode, the cemetery is described as \"a lovely smalltown cemetery\" with \"the usual weathered headstones\".\nThe filming location for Laura Palmer's funeral is located at the Sierra Madre Pioneer Cemetery 601 E Sierra Madre Blvd, Sierra Madre, California.
