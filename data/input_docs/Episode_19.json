He says that Jeffrey beats Evelyn once every week or two, and no one can stop him.\nCooper and Irene visit the lake house and she shares a legend that the best people and the worst people are drawn to a dead dog because they can feel its pain. She says no one has looked at the property in the last year, but Cooper finds tracks from three vehicles. The door is open: Cooper believes there has been a meeting there in the past few hours. There is baby laxative in the sink, and cocaine on a chair. Cooper says they will notify the sheriff.\nDick sits on the road reading directions for changing a flat tire as Nicky plays with the controls. The car falls off the jack, and Nicky runs to hug Dick and asks him not to die.\nHarry introduces Cooper to Colonel Reilly, who is heading the investigation into Major Briggs' disappearance.

Hawk tries to comfort Lana, and the men gather around to admire her and recite a line from Romeo and Juliet. Lucy answers the phone for Harry, but he does not respond, because he, like the other men present at the station, are transfixed by Lana, who tells them titillating stories and drinks milk.\nErnie eats wings in the diner and Denise joins him and shows him the photos along with her DEA badge. Ernie delivers a confession to Cooper and Denise, pleading his love for his wife.\nJames lies awake listening to Jeffrey shouting and glass crashing. Malcolm tells him they have been living like that for four years, and that one day he will kill Jeffrey.\nBetty Briggs sits alone in the dark waiting for Bobby.
