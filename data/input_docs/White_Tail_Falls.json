The waterfall was a popular destination for tourists to the region. A local fable said that those who fell in love within earshot of the falls would remain so for all time.\nHistory\nWhite Tail Falls was created as a result of the Okanagan subcontinent colliding with North America, approximately one hundred million years ago.\nIn the winter of 1942, an unidentified man was rescued while attempting to swim the rapids beneath the waterfall, and treated for frostbite at Calhoun Memorial Hospital.\nIn the mid-twentieth century, J.J. Horne built the Great Northern Hotel resort and spa on a bluff directly overlooking the falls.\nEvery July, the Twin Peaks Independence Day celebration included an inner-tube race on the river at the bottom. Occasionally, swimmers were killed attempting to ride down the falls in a barrel.\nAs of 1989, the Twin Peaks Chamber of Commerce offered bus tours to the waterfall at 3:00 p.m. daily, departing from Town Hall.\nIn February 1990, exactly one year after his daughter Laura disappeared, Leland Palmer shot himself while sitting in his parked car near the falls.\nBehind the scenes\nThe scenes featuring the waterfall were filmed at Snoqualmie Falls, located on the Snoqualmie River between Snoqualmie and Falls City, Washington."}
