{"name": "Waldo", "url": "https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Waldo", "text": "Waldo\nWaldo was a myna bird belonging to Jacques Renault. It was present at the murder of Laura Palmer, having attacked her during her final moments. It was a key witness to the investigation, having remembered the phrase, \"Leo, no!\"\nHistory\nOn the night of February 23, 1989, Jacques, Leo Johnson, Ronette Pulaski, and Laura Palmer participated in a drug-fueled orgy. At one point, Jacques opened Waldo's cage and the bird pecked at her shoulders.\nFollowing Laura's murder later that night, FBI Agent Albert Rosenfield discovered Waldo's claw marks upon her shoulders. While searching the records from the Lydecker Veterinary Clinic, Andy Brennan found a file for Waldo. \nAfter finding the picture of Jacques's cabin FBI Agent Dale Cooper and members of the Twin Peaks Sheriff's Department trekked into the woods and find the cabin from the picture. Inside, they found Waldo in his cage.\nThe lawmen brought the bird back to the Sheriff's Station along with camera film that revealed a photo of Waldo upon Laura's shoulder. Doctor Hayward and Harry studied Waldo, Hayward saying it would start talking once it was healthy. In case the bird were to talk while nobody was present, Cooper left his Micro-Mac tape recorder in the room with it. The bird was recorded saying '\"hurting me, stop it, Leo, no\" and \"Laura?\" as well as wolf-whistling.\nLeo listened to a police broadcast of Lucy Moran talking about Waldo and drove away to the Sheriff's Station. Alone in the conference room, Waldo said \"Laura?\" Leo shot the bird through the window, also breaking a picture. The officers made their way to the conference room to find Waldo dead and listened to the recordings.\nPhoto\nWaldo at the Sheriff's station"}
