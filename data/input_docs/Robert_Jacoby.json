The next year, his parents divorced and he returned to Washington with his father, while his younger brother Lawrence and his mother Esther stayed in Hawaii.\nHe later built a career as a journalist and later editor of the Twin Peaks Gazette, later renamed Twin Peaks Post by Douglas Milford. In 1984, the Twin Peaks town council commissioned him to write Oh, What a Tangled Web..., in which he chronicled the history of the town.\nFollowing his death from complications from multiple sclerosis, his ashes were scattered at Pearl Lakes, while his brother kept some of them to scatter in the bay with their mother's remains in Hawaii.

However, many articles written by him appear to have been published after that date, and he is once again stated to have died, except on the significantly different date of November 19, 1986."}
