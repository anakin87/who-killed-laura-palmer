By the 1920s, it had evolved into Horne's Department Store.\nBy the 1980s, Benjamin Horne had inherited the business and it was managed by Emory Battis until his death in 1989. Battis would recruit girls working in the perfume department to also work at One Eyed Jacks, a brothel and casino in Canada, also owned by Horne. The girls he recruited included Ronette Pulaski and Laura Palmer.\nBenjamin Horne's daughter, Audrey Horne briefly worked in the store's perfume department and Dick Tremayne worked in men's fashion.\nPersonnel\nEmory Battis (store manager)\nDick Tremayne (men's fashion)\nStockroom boy\nPerfume department\nAudrey Horne\nJenny\nLaura Palmer\nRonette Pulaski\nGallery\nInvitation to Love promotion in perfume departmentPerfume department\nBehind the scenes\nThe exterior filming location for Horne's Department Store was the Pacific Commercial Building at 240 2nd Ave S, Seattle, Washington.
