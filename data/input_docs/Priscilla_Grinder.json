Grinder stated that after dinner, Lewis acted strangely, pacing while smoking his pipe and talking to himself \"like a lawyer,\" and ranting about \"enemies\" all while fiddling with a leather pouch that hung around his neck.\nGrinder claimed that Lewis returned to a more even state of mind after dark, but refused a bed from her, instead sleeping on a pallet near his pistols.\nShe slept in a nearby cabin with her children until she was awoken around 3:00 a.m. by sounds of a struggle culminating in two gunshots and Lewis crying out \"Oh, Lord!\" Too frightened to help Lewis, she watched him through cracks in the cabin wall as he staggered in the moonlight.\nAt dawn, she woke Lewis' servants and found him still alive in a pool of his own blood, caused by two gunshot wounds and slashes to his throat and arms. According to Grinder, Lewis pleaded for his men to kill him with his rifle.\nGrinder recounted these events to Major James Neely, who reported the death as a suicide.\nResidents of a local Tennessee county accused Grinder, her husband, and \"parties unknown\" of murdering Lewis. Ultimately, the charges were dropped due to the jury's \"fear of retribution.\"\nShortly thereafter, Grinder and his wife left Tennessee after coming into \"a substantial sum of money.\"\nBehind the scenes\nPriscilla Knight Griner (1771 \u2013 1848) was the wife of Robert Griner, proprietor of Griner's Stand, where Meriwether Lewis died in 1809."}
