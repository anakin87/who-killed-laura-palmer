As he approached the driver's side door, Billy became sick to his stomach, doubling over and warning his partner to stay away. The other trooper radioed for backup and advised that they bring gas masks.\nSubsequently, Billy was admitted to the hospital to be treated for his exposure to Cooper's vomit."}
