Confused, Hank first shouted at them thinking that had been sent by Harvey, and then, worriedly, asked who told them that he was going to see Chip. Marjorie Green then appeared, telling the officers that she remembered she had a key to Ruth Davenport's unit. As they went back inside, Hank called after them, asking if he was free to go.\nLater, Hank called Harvey, accusing him of sending the police. He confirmed that he still had \"all of it,\" but reminded Harvey that he had opted out, and said it belonged to him and Chip now."}
