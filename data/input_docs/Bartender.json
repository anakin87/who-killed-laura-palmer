Minutes later, he rushed over to find that the trucker sitting next to her had fallen over dead, a huge piece torn out of his throat. In disbelief, he asked what had happened, and she pleaded ignorance, insisting that she had been minding her own business. The bartender told his wife to call 9-1-1 and warned that they would \"see about this.\" Sarah wryly said that it certainly was a \"mystery.\""}
