(x4)For the last time (x4)At night I'm driving in your carPretending that we'll leave this townWe're watching all the street lights fadeAnd now you're just a stranger's dreamI took your picture from the frameAnd now you're nothing like you seemYour shadow fell like last night's rainFor the last time (x4)\nCredits\nPerformed by Chromatics\nWritten by Adam Miller, Johnny Jewel, and Nat Walker\nFrom the album Dear Tommy\nCourtesy of Italians Do It Better"}
