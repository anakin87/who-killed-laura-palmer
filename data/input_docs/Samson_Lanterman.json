Yet, I feel him near me. Sometimes I can almost see him. At night when the wind blows, I think of what he might have been. Again I wonder: why?\"\n \u2015Margaret Lanterman\nSamson \"Sam\" Lanterman was a lumberjack and volunteer fire chief who was the husband of Margaret Lanterman.\nBiography\nSam was a third-generation woodsman and the eldest of five brothers. At one time, he was the Packard Sawmill's youngest lumberjack in its history. By the age of fifteen, he competed in lumberjack competitions.\nOne spring, Lanterman went to Haw's Lumber Yard to drop off lumber he and one of his brothers salvaged from a barn. Seeing Margaret Coulson load up a truck with two-by-sixes for a cabin she was building and offered his assistance. The pair were immediately smitten with each other and began dating. Exactly a year after they met, Sam prposed to Margaret near Glastonbury Grove. She accepted and they set their wedding date for a year after that.\nSam and Margaret were married in a small ceremony at the Chapel-in-the-Woods, with Sam's family and close friends in attendance. A thunderstorm brewed during the ceremony and an alarm sounded during the reception, alerting the town to a forest fire started by a bolt of lightning. Sam hurriedly left his reception to help put out the fire alongside his father and brothers.\nWhile fighting the fire, a gust of wind fatally pushed Sam off of a ridge and into a burning ravine. Sarah Palmer would later recall to her daughter that Sam instead tripped over a root and fell face-first onto hot coals, burning to death. The blaze's only casualty, his body was later recovered and buried by Margaret two days later behind the cabin they had been building for six months."}
