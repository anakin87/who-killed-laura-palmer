After the woodsman left the radio station, a horse was heard neighing in the distance.\n \n \nA white horse briefly materialized in Sarah Palmer's room on the night of February 22, 1989, as Sarah lay in bed, having just been drugged by her husband Leland. This occurred just as Leland was preparing to molest their daughter, Laura.\nThe following month, Sarah crawled through the house, trying to maintain consciousness. She was shocked to see the horse appear in their living room just before she passed out on the floor. While she was unconscious, Leland (controlled by BOB) attacked and beat their niece Maddy Ferguson to death.\nWhile Dale Cooper was trapped in the red room, the curtains lifted as if in a strong wind to reveal a white horse standing in the distance.\nAfter crossing, Cooper spotted a kiddie ride of a white horse outside Eat at Judy's in Odessa, Texas. A waitress at the diner, Carrie Page, had a small white horse figurine in front of a blue plate sitting on her mantelpiece.\nBehind the scenes\nIn the script for \"Episode 14\" and the accompanying Log Lady introduction, the horse is referred to as \"pale horse,\" while in the script of Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me it is called a \"white horse.\"\nIn the documentary Lynch (One), David Lynch recounts being deeply affected by a scene in the French slaughterhouse documentary Blood of the Beasts, in which a tall and majestic white horse is abruptly slaughtered and its blood collected in a square box."}
