He used the cabin as a rendezvous with Leo Johnson, Ronette Pulaski, and Laura Palmer.\nHistory\nOn February 24, 1989, James Hurley began to take Laura home, but she jumped off of his bike at the intersection of Highway 21 and Sparkwood Road. In tears, she told him \"his Laura\" is gone. Screaming that she loved him, Laura ran away from James into the woods, where Jacques, Leo, and Ronette waited near Leo's red corvette.\nTogether, they drove to the foot of the trail leading to Jacques's cabin. They climbed the trail, passing by Margaret Lanterman's cabin. Then they hold an orgy in Jacques' cabin, Leland Palmer soon arriving and watching from outside. Later, Leland attacked Jacques outside, and Leo fled in a panic. Leland took Laura and Ronette, both bound, to the train car.\n \nOn March 1, during a search of Jacques's apartment, FBI Agent Dale Cooper found a photo of the cabin and the officers went to the woods in search of it. They found the cabin from the picture and entered as a record player played \"Into the Night\" on vinyl, making Cooper remark that \"there is always music in the air.\" There, they found Waldo in a birdcage, twine, a bloodstain on the floor, and a poker chip inside the cuckoo clock, missing a piece of the same shape that was found in Laura's stomach.\nBehind the scenes\n \nA different exterior was used for the cabin between its appearance in Twin Peaks and Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me."}
