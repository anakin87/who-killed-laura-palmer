At one point, he took off the mask brieflly to reveal that his face had been replaced with that of a monkey.\nAfter Laura Palmer's murder, the same monkey spoke the word \"Judy.\"\nShowtime's closed captioning for Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me indicated that the monkey spoke with Phillip Jeffries' voice, but producer Sabrina Sutherland refuted this."}
