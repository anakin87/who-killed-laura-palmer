However, the idea was vetoed by Mark Frost, who felt it was \"too dumb.\"\nLenny von Dohlen suggested the night before the discovery of Harold's body was to shoot that instead of seeing him hanging, viewers would hear the sound of hissing gas and the camera would reveal all of his orchids were slumped over, with Harold's body lying nearby. David Lynch, knowing they had already built the rafter from which Harold was supposed to hang, left a message on Dohlen's voicemail: \"Lenny, never come up with a great idea the night before a shoot!\"\nWhen Twin Peaks was rerun on the Bravo cable network in 1993, at the exact moment the killer begins strangling Maddy, the \"Bravo\" logo appeared on the screen as if applauding Maddy's murder.\nDavid Patrick Kelly has confirmed that a person who resembles Jerry that appears during Julee Cruise's concert is not him.\nProduction errors\nWhen Nadine and Ed enter the Double R, the camera bumps into something on its right and bounces left.\nDeleted scenes\nThe scene with Leland/BOB killing Maddy was alternatively filmed with Ben Horne as the murderer. This was done in order to disseminate rumors to the public that Horne indeed was the killer. However, this footage has never been released."}
