They sneak up on ya'.\"\n \u2015Judge Clinton Sternwood\nThe Black Yukon Sucker Punch was a cocktail drunk by locals of Twin Peaks, Washington.\nHistory\n \nAt the Roadhouse, during the trial of Leo Johnson for the arson of the Packard Sawmill, Judge Clinton Sternwood requested his law clerk Sid to prepare three cocktails for himself, Sheriff Harry S. Truman, and Special Agent Dale Cooper.\nBehind the bar, Sid produced three tall straight collins glasses, a coffee pot, a bottle of Jack Daniel's whiskey, a bottle of BOLS Blue Curacao liqueur, two bottles of Perrier mineral water, a dish and a blender. She used the blender before pouring three collins glasses half-filled with a black liquid and topped with a light blue foam.\nSternwood and Truman drank their own but Cooper left his untouched.\nBehind the scenes\nIn Barry Pullman's shooting script, Sternwood orders only one \"Black Yukon on Sucker Punch\" for himself which is simply described in the directions as \"an elaborate drink.\"\nNo official recipe was released but the credited staff of the episode which could furnish the bar set are: Set Decorator Kerry Oaksmith, Construction Coordinator Keith Cox, Prop master Jeffrey Moore, assisted by Richard Robinson. The director was Graeme Clifford.\nWOWOW broadcast version\nFor a Japanese marathon by WowoW, a short segment with a waitress named Robin Kraemer from the Little Si Restaurant at North Bend uses the following recipe for the Black Yukon Supper Punch:\n1 shot of Yukon Jack\n1 shot of Mr.Boston Blackberry flavored Brandy\nDash of Bitters\nPut in blender with ice\nBlend about 5 seconds\nThe end result does not have the blue foam and the liquid is not as dark as the TV one."}
