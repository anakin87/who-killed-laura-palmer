Special Agent Dale Cooper: My Life, My Tapes\nThe Autobiography of F.B.I. Special Agent Dale Cooper is the second Twin Peaks novel, written by Scott Frost.\nThe novel is presented as a collection of transcripts from Agent Dale Cooper's audio tapes, from his childhood to the day he is assigned to the Laura Palmer case. The book includes Dale's upbringing in Philadelphia, family, education at Quaker institutions Germantown Friends School and Haverford College, first stumbles with love, obsession with the FBI, and the relationship between him, Windom Earle, and Earle's wife, Caroline. Many of these tape transcripts are dictated to \"Diane,\" though a later tape states that Cooper enjoys the thought of Diane listening to his tapes so much that he will address all tapes to her, whether she will ever listen to them or not.\nDiscrepancies\n\nContinuity errors\nAlbert Rosenfield's surname is spelled as \"Rosenfelt.\"\nCaroline Earle is stated to have died in 1979, when in the series, Cooper said she died \"four years ago,\" which would place her murder around 1985.\nThe largest inconsistencies lie with the murder of Teresa Banks, as the book was written before the making of Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me.\nIn the book, Teresa's body is found in a ditch, she worked at Cross River Caf\u00e9 and she lived in a lakeside cabin, none of which is true in the film.\nIn the book, Cooper investigates Teresa's murder. In the film, the case is assigned to Chester Desmond and Sam Stanley. It was originally planned for Cooper to investigate in the film, but Kyle MacLachlan wished to have a smaller role.\nThe Final Dossier has many inconsistencies with this novel, especially the Windom Earle related sections, but the former explains that Diane's double heavily modified the content of the tapes while doing their transcripts.\nHistorical inaccuracies\nCooper says on April 20, 1968 that he performed the Heimlich maneuver on his scoutmaster. However, the Heimlich maneuver was first introduced in 1974.\nRobert F. Kennedy's assassination is presented in the book as if he died within hours after his shooting, as Cooper's father gets him out of bed at 3:30 a.m. on June 6 to watch news coverage, as if his shooting was just reported. At 5:00 a.m., Cooper indicates that Kennedy had died by then. While the time of death is accurate, Kennedy was shot 26 hours before his death and it was reported by the media quickly after it occurred, which would almost certainly mean that the Coopers would have already been aware of the shooting.\nCooper notes on May 12, 1969 that it is Mother's Day. In real life, Mother's Day that year was on the day before."}
