She requested to go back into the room with him, where he worked, but with a security guard present, she could not.\nShe returned sometime later with another coffee for him. This time, they could not find a security guard anywhere, so Sam took Tracey into the room with him. After a few moments of watching the box, they began to make out. When they engaged in sex, a ghostly figure appeared in the box and broke through to slaughter them."}
