A light on the set fell and hit Robert Knepper right below his eye on his cheekbone, and David Lynch devised the scene between Candie and Rod to explain the cut on his face.\nDuring the filming of Cooper and Janey-E's sex scene, Kyle MacLachlan was only given the direction to lie down on the bed and more or less be passive. As it was being shot, his arms began naturally bouncing with the motions of the bed, prompting the director of photography to lean in and whisper, \"Keep doing the arms, it's hilarious!\"\nOne address on the letter is:\nMarvin Marcia\n91846 W Elmford Row Pl.\nTwin \nProduction errors\nThe prop department mistakenly gave Miriam Sullivan the surname \"Hodges\" in her address.\nA visual glitch occurs on the doorknob when Tammy goes to Gordon's apartment.\nWhen Chad stand in front of Lucy's desk, he places his hands on his belt but on the reverse shot, they appear to be on his belly, then, on the next shot, on his belt again."}
