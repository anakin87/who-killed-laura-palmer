They leaned disinterestedly against a wall as Rodney beat the man.\nOne night, Mandie and Sandie prepared martinis for the Mitchums as they watched the news on television. Sandie tried to console Candie as she wept, but was pushed away, and shrugged at Rodney.\nThey leaned against the wall in the surveillance room as Anthony Sinclair arrived to break some important news to the Mitchums regarding their insurance claim.\nThe next evening, Mandie and Sandie joined the Mitchums and Dale Cooper at Santino's after being delayed in traffic, where they brought the men more pie at their request.\nThe girls performed a conga line through the Lucky 7 Insurance office with Cooper and the Mitchums, delivering gifts to Bushnell Mullins as thanks for honoring their original insurance claim.\nWhen Cooper fell into a shock-induced coma, the Mitchums' entourage brought finger sandwiches and a giant bouquet to his hospital room. Afterwards, they all visited the Jones home to restock the kitchen.\nThe girls accompanied the Mitchums and Cooper in the limousine as Cooper explained that he needed to get to the Twin Peaks Sheriff's Department."}
