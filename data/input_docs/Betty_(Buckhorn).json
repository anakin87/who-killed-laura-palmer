{"name": "Betty_(Buckhorn)", "url": "https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Betty_(Buckhorn)", "text": "Betty (Buckhorn)\nFor the mental patient, see Betty (Haverford).\nBetty was high school principal William Hastings' secretary.\nBiography\nIn March 2014, a visitor to Hastings' blog, Adam Z., commented that Betty was \"so cool.\"\nHastings gave Betty a copy of important coordinates, which he and Ruth Davenport had found on behalf of \"the Major,\" a man they had met in an alternate dimension. Dale Cooper's doppelganger was in pursuit of these same coordinates, and he hired Ray Monroe to get them from Betty.\nAfter his arrest, Hastings claimed that the previous Thursday night he had driven Betty home from a school staff evaluation meeting, around the time of Ruth Davenport's murder.\nBy late September 2016, despite his detainment in federal prison, Ray had apparently succeeded in obtaining the coordinates, and attempted to extort Cooper for $500,000 in exchange for the information. Betty was killed in her car by a bomb planted by Cooper and Jack."}
