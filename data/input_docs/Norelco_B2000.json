The recorder required the use of a power outlet, which limited Cooper's ability to travel with it until he purchased a battery pack from Simms' Hardware.\nCooper used the Norelco B2000 until September 12, 1973, when his father gave him a notebook-sized recorder that recorded cassettes instead of reels."}
