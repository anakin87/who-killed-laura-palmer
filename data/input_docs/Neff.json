{"name": "Neff", "url": "https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Neff", "text": "Neff\nNeff was an insurance agent.\nIn early March 1989, Neff met with Catherine Martell to discuss an insurance policy regarding the death of her brother. He urged her to sign it, but she did not, as her sister-in-law, Josie Packard was the sole beneficiary and she told Neff she wished to discuss the policy with her lawyer.\nBehind the scenes\nNeff is named after Fred MacMurray's character, Walter Neff, from the 1944 film noir, Double Indemnity. His occupation may also be a nod to the film's Neff being an insurance salesman.\nIn the shooting script of Episode 6, he is named Herbert Bell, though a typo calls him Bond at one point. Catherine also calls him Ball once, before he corrected her."}
