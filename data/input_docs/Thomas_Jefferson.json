Lewis informed the President of his intention to explore the area charted in the map.\nAfter weeks of silence from Lewis, Jefferson received communication from him that Jefferson surmised to have been written in the midst of delirium, as it contained strange and often incoherent ramblings alongside Lewis' usual writing. Jefferson reflected on these writings in his journals.\nBy October 1809, Jefferson was succeeded in office by James Madison.\nFollowing Lewis' death, Jefferson was informed by Major James Neely, who stated his death to have been suicide. However, in the following weeks, he received a letter from Major Gilbert Russell, who described the death as \"murder.\" Despite this, another letter from Russell \u2013 dated two years after and possibly forged \u2013 described Lewis as having been \"deranged\" and that he had attempted suicide multiple times prior to his death. This letter cemented Jefferson's opinion that Lewis committed suicide.\nFollowing the return of the Corps of Discovery in 1807, Jefferson appointed Lewis governor of the Upper Louisiana Territory and at some point initiated him into Freemasonry.\nJefferson's writings on Lewis' letters were stored alongside various writings on Freemasonry and supernatural beliefs of Native Americans. These writings resided in a maximum-security section of the Library of Congress as of the 1940s.\nBehind the scenes\nThomas Jefferson (April 13, 1743 \u2013 July 4, 1826) was the third President of the United States and one of the nation's Founding Fathers, having been the primary author of the Declaration of Independence.\nJefferson's journals were narrated by Len Cariou in the audiobook version of The Secret History of Twin Peaks."}
