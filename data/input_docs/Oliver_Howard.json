In August, Howard sent word to Colonel Nelson Miles, in awe of Joseph's implausible retreat to British Columbia and commanded Miles to intercept Joseph, who eventually surrendered on October 5.\nHoward ordered his adjutant, Captain Charles Erskine Wood, to take Joseph as a prisoner of war. When Chief White Bird escaped captivity, Howard felt this was a violation of the terms of surrender on Joseph's part, thus absolving the American government's responsibility to return the Native Americans to their land.\nBehind the scenes\nOliver Otis Howard (November 8, 1830 \u2013 October 26, 1909) was a United States Army officer who served in the Civil War and later commanded several campaigns against Native American tribes.\nChris Mulkey provided narration for Howard's dispatch for Colonel Miles in the audiobook version of The Secret History of Twin Peaks."}
