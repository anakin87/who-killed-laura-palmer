For the character of the same name from the TV series, see Andy Brennan.\nAndy was a college love interest of Dale Cooper.\nBiography\nCooper first met Andy while meeting students from Bryn Mawr College. However, he drank too much to remember even for sure what her hair color was but was determined to meet her again.\nThe two encountered each other a month later after Cooper was hit in the head by a field hockey ball hit by Andy. When he came to, they talked a little bit and decided to meet at the homecoming bonfire that was being held the next night.\nDale and Andy met at the bonfire and had a sexual encounter in a spot among large trees and shaded from the moon and they rolled into a small body of water. After getting back into their clothes, Andy informed Cooper that she would be leaving for an exchange trip to Holland in the morning and said to not follow her, as her husband would be meeting her at the airport, this being her first revelation to him that she was married.\nAndy returned early the next year without her husband and gave Cooper a book on the Kama Sutra. She later joined Cooper in a motel room for a \"study on the limitations of the mind and body.\"\nWeeks later, Andy received word that her husband had become injured in Holland and decided to return and she broke off her affair with Cooper."}
