{"name": "Gilbert_Russell", "url": "https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Gilbert_Russell", "text": "Gilbert Russell\nMajor Gilbert Russell was the commander of Fort Pickering in 1809 and a friend to Meriwether Lewis.\nAccording to a possibly forged letter to Thomas Jefferson and attributed to Russell, after arriving in a \"state of mental derangement,\" Lewis attempted suicide twice between St. Louis and Fort Pickering. This prompted Russell to incarcerate him upon a third attempt until he was \"completely in his senses.\"\nIn an earlier letter written to Jefferson shortly after Lewis' death, Russell portrayed Lewis as having been in good spirits and referred to his death as a murder.\nBehind the scenes\nMajor Gilbert C. Russell was the commander Fort Pickering at the time of Meriwether Lewis' death. As portrayed in The Secret History of Twin Peaks, two letters concerning Lewis and attributed to Russell appear to contradict each other, a factor that has helped fuel debate over whether Lewis' death was murder or suicide."}
