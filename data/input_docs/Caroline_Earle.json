She was also having a serious relationship with Dale Cooper, and later, was murdered by Windom.\nBiography\nWhen Caroline first met her husband's partner Dale Cooper, she told him that she hoped that taking a life would not affect his life the way it did her husband's.\nWhen her husband disappeared, she began to form a close bond with Dale, and following Windom's return in 1985, she was allegedly kidnapped by three men and was forced into prostitution and heroin addiction.\nFollowing this, she was moved to a safehouse, where her husband decided not to stay, thus sparking an affair between Caroline and Dale. However, within days, the lovers were stabbed by Windom, and Caroline died, as her aorta had been severed.\nCaroline later appeared to Dale in the Black Lodge, taking Annie Blackburn's place, who said that her husband killed her. Annie then took her place.\nBehind the scenes\nThe Autobiography of F.B.I. Special Agent Dale Cooper: My Life, My Tapes states Caroline's death to have occurred in 1979. However, in Twin Peaks (which takes place in 1989), Cooper states her death to have occurred \"four years ago.\" This inconsistency is repeated in Twin Peaks: The Final Dossier. Additionally, The Final Dossier gives Caroline's maiden name as \"Wickam\" despite \"Episode 22\" stating it to be \"Powell.\""}
