Heidi claimed she could not get her car started, so Shelly finished the thought with \"too busy jump-starting the old man again.\" She giggled all the way to the kitchen.\nWhen asked on Twitter, Andrea Hays explained her absence between Pilot and Episode 29 as \"I was, I'm just super shy and would hide out in the kitchen with Toad making ham sammachies. OR you just always came in on my day off??\"\n2010s\nHeidi still worked at the diner twenty-five years later and had become acquainted with customer Miriam Sullivan, who one day left a tip that Heidi and Shelly agreed she could not afford.
