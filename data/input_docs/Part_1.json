(ASCAP)\n\"Sub Dream\"\nWritten and Performed by David Lynch and Dean Hurley\n\"Frank 2000\"\nWritten by Angelo Badalamenti and David Lynch\nPerformed by Thought Gang\nBehind the scenes\nThe filming of Sam and Tracey's brutal murder by the Experiment was achieved by spraying actors Ben Rosenfield and Madeline Zima with blood from a hose as the camera zoomed in on them. A further \"dry\" take was also done without the blood at the suggestion of Zima, though the final cut of the episode uses the blood take. Lynch initially planned to also bat them in the face with two large blue balls on sticks, but these are absent from behind-the-scenes footage of the take and Lynch is only shown directing the scene. Neither actor was told or shown what exactly they were reacting to, and all further effects work of the Experiment's attack was done in post-production.\nSam and Tracey's coffee cups are rather obviously empty, based on how they are held by Ben Rosenfield and Madeline Zima. This, along with several other instances in The Return of characters carrying and handling cups that are very clearly empty, earned Twin Peaks an \"Empty Cup Award,\" a satirical award from the online magazine Slate which draws attention to this phenomenon in modern TV.\nTV-14 edit\nA TV-14 version of the episode \u2014 edited for language and sexual content \u2014 was released for the American region on YouTube for a limited time in observance of National Donut Day in early June 2017. It was released again for a limited time on August 8, 2017.\nTrivia\nLynch considers the piece of meat discovered in the car as just a piece of meat and nothing specific like a tongue or a kidney."}
