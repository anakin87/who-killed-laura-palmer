{"name": "Toad_(cook)", "url": "https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Toad_(cook)", "text": "Toad (cook)\nFor the diner's frequent customer of the same name, see Toad.\nToad was a cook at the Double R Diner.\nBiography\nThe cook commented to Norma Jennings one 1989 day at the diner about how quiet business had been.\nToad was still working at the diner as of late 2016, and would pick up deliveries of bread from Shelly's daughter, Becky Burnett. One night, Norma told Toad to shut off the lights when somebody fired a gun through the diner's window.\nBehind the scenes\nToad was played by Marv Rosand, who died on September 21, 2015. He appears posthumously in the 2017 series of Twin Peaks. Although referred to as Toad in the shooting script of Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, this name was never used on-screen for the character until his appearance in Part 5.\nHe seems to be unrelated to the customer Toad: the name similarity may come from the fact that Lynch forgot about the previous character while making the movie.\nIn episode 6, an uncredited Bob Stephenson portrayed a burger cook. Another cook with no lines appeared in Episode 28 of Twin Peaks, played by an uncredited JC Motes. It is unknown if they are intended to be the same character."}
