{"name": "Pearblossom_Motel", "url": "https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Pearblossom_Motel", "text": "Pearblossom Motel\nThe Pearblossom Motel was a lodging visited by Dale Cooper and Diane Evans after the two crossed.\nHistory\nAfter driving through the night, Cooper and Diane stopped at the motel. While Cooper went inside to rent a room, Diane sat in silence, and saw what appeared to be her twin step out from behind a column, staring at her. The other figure disappeared as Cooper emerged and directed her to room #7.\nInside, Cooper ordered her to turn off the lights and come across the room to join him. They kissed and proceed to have sex, mechanically. In increasing distress, Diane avoided Cooper's gaze and began covering his face with her hands.\nThe next morning, Cooper awoke alone and found that Diane had disappeared. He found a letter on the end table from \"Linda,\" addressed to \"Richard,\" saying that their relationship was over. Confused, Cooper repeated the two names to himself. He emerged from his room and observed that the motel's exterior and whereabouts seemed to have changed overnight, as had the vehicle in which he had arrived.\nBehind the scenes\nThe scenes featuring the hotel during the nighttime were shot on location at the Pearblossom Inn, a motel at 13250 Pearblossom Hwy near Pearblossom, California. The exteriors during the daytime were shot on location at the Knights' Inn at 130 E Palmdale Blvd, Palmdale, California."}
