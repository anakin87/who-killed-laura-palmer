A mechanism in the room began to emit a strange noise and the Fireman came to investigate before leaving the room.\nSenorita Dido followed him to a theater, where he was levitating and emitting a golden cloud, from which an orb containing the image of Laura Palmer appeared. It floated to her hands and she kissed it before sending it to Earth."}
