{"name": "Bittner", "url": "https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Bittner", "text": "Bittner\nBittner was a private security officer hired to guard a glass box installed in a New York City skyscraper.\nBiography\nBittner sat at a desk in an anteroom outside a loft where workers were hired to watch a glass box and report anything that appeared inside. He notified the worker on duty, Sam Colby, that he had a visit from Tracey. She had brought two lattes and asked if she could join him, but Bittner said nobody else was allowed inside.\nOn another night, the guard on duty, possibly Bittner, was gone when Tracey arrived, and could not be found in the office or the adjoining restroom. Following Sam and Tracey's deaths, the New York Police Department could not locate any of the security guards who worked on the project."}
