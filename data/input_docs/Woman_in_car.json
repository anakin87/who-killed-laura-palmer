We're late for dinner, it's way past six thirty! WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?!\"\nAn unidentified woman was caught in a traffic jam outside the Double R Diner after a boy fired a gun out of his car.\nThe woman, already late to a 6:30 dinner with a sick girl and the girl's uncle, honked her horn incessantly while Deputy Bobby Briggs questioned the boy and his family. When he approached her open window, she bellowed at him in frustration and said that they desperately needed to get home. Suddenly, the girl began convulsing and leaned toward Bobby, vomiting a green liquid, as the woman screamed in terror."}
