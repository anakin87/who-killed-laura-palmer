{"name": "Jim", "url": "https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Jim", "text": "Jim\nJim was an attendant working at the morgue of Calhoun Memorial Hospital in 1989.\nBiography\nJim was present in the morgue when Leland Palmer arrived with Sheriff Truman to positively identify the body of his daughter Laura.\nWhen Dale Cooper arrived to inspect the body, the morgue's fluorescent lights were not functioning properly, for which Jim apologized. Spotting something under the ring fingernail of Laura's left hand, Cooper asked Jim if he could leave them alone for a moment. Jim, apparently mishearing, instead gave his name. After an awkward moment, Cooper repeated his question, and Jim quickly obliged.\nBehind the scenes\nJim was portrayed by an unknown extra.\nJim mishearing Cooper's question was a real-life blooper: the extra misheard the line, and gave his real first name, prompting Kyle MacLachlan to repeat Cooper's question. David Lynch liked the improvised lifelike dialogue and kept it in the final episode."}
